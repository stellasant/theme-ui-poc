-   You can use it as a boilerplate ready to use for your new project on MS

-   TIP: We recommend you to follow all our standardized best practices to structure the project and create components

# Technical Info

## Info

-   Project created with create-react-app template --typescript
    -   More info: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/
-   We use Typescript as a common rule for projects

## Dependencies

-   Theme UI:
    https://theme-ui.com/
-   React Components Foundation of ant.design:
    https://github.com/react-component
    -   All components: http://react-component.github.io/badgeboard/
    -   Note: You can import each component individually
- Polished: https://polished.js.org/docs/

## Why use ThemeUI?

- ThemeUI has breakpoints that you can define within an array
- You have also variants that are variations of styles for common components like buttons
- Its color modes allows us to create, for example dark modes of our app easily
- There's a custom tool that will build out your theme object for you to copy and paste into your project
- With the sx prop, it's no more necessary to use Styled Components and that makes the code cleaner and more understandable
- Theme UI has excellent documentation. The getting started guide is clear and the organization is logical

## Why Polished?

- It is a utility library, so you only import what you need. The nice thing about this library is that no matter what you style your components with, Polished works with all of them.
